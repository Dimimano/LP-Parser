# LP-Parser

The software's  main target is to read through a text file, the user's input (a linear programming problem). It can detect the problem's type (min/max), the objective function and the constraints, and works both for integer and decimal coefficients. After reading the input the software creates matrices that contain all of the problem's data and are ready to be used by a solver.
As a secondary target the software can convert the linear problem which was provided to its dual problem.
